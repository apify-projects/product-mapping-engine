/**
 * `LaunchContext` holds information about the launched browser. It's useful
 * to retrieve the `launchOptions`, the proxy the browser was launched with
 * or any other information user chose to add to the `LaunchContext` by calling
 * its `extend` function. This is very useful to keep track of browser-scoped
 * values, such as session IDs.
 * @property {string} id
 *  To make identification of `LaunchContext` easier, `BrowserPool` assigns
 *  the `LaunchContext` an `id` that's equal to the `id` of the page that
 *  triggered the browser launch. This is useful, because many pages share
 *  a single launch context (single browser).
 * @property {BrowserPlugin} browserPlugin
 *  The `BrowserPlugin` instance used to launch the browser.
 * @property {object} launchOptions
 *  The actual options the browser was launched with, after changes.
 *  Those changes would be typically made in pre-launch hooks.
 * @property {boolean} [useIncognitoPages]
 *  By default pages share the same browser context.
 *  If set to true each page uses its own context that is destroyed once the page is closed or crashes.
 * @property {object} [userDataDir]
 *  Path to a User Data Directory, which stores browser session data like cookies and local storage.
